### [Microsoft Learn Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dotnet-microservices/)

Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other over standard protocols with well-defined interfaces. 

Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently. Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module will teach you how to build your first microservice with .NET.

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Explain what microservices are.
- Know how various technologies involved in microservices are and how they relate.
- Build a microservice using .NET.
